## Get Started
- `napari` to run napari.
- drag in a tiff stack
- drag in the first frame annotation
  - this annotation is supposed to be generated by cellpose and named in cellpose style.
  - tracking from other frames than the first frame is not implemented yet.
- now that we have 1. an Image layer with N frames. 2. a Labels layer which have masks annotation on first frame, we are ready to run cutie tracking.
- Plugins -> Cutie Track(napari-cutie) -> set appropriate parameters -> track

## development log
### 07/19/2024
- basic track code fix, now it works thoroughly as expected.
- add a **shift** checkbox. when check, *the tracking box follows cells' movement*.
  - so now, if you don't check the **shift** checkbox, it is a fixed version of original version.
  - if you check the **shift** checkbox, you can see how the new feature works.

> You could find that the shift method doesn't work well. 
> 
> A given processor must receive image with same box size, totally depend on first frame annotation, as input on each frame.
> However, some cells could have intensive changes in its shape and size, so that the box may not cover the whole cell.
> 
> And, when using shift, it tends to mis-track one cell to another.
> 
> The codes work perfectly as expected since I've done lots of checks and experiments.
> The problems described above are all about the "shift" method itself.
